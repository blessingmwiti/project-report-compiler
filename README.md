# Project Report Compiler

A VS Code/Cursor extension that automatically tracks your project work by monitoring git commits and generates beautiful weekly/monthly reports for your job reporting needs.

## Features

- **Automatic Git Commit Tracking**: Monitors all your git repositories for new commits
- **User-Specific Filtering**: Automatically filters commits to show only your work, excluding other contributors (configurable)
- **Project Detection**: Automatically detects project names from working directories
- **Human-Readable Reports**: Generates formatted reports showing what you worked on and when
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Export reports as Markdown, HTML, or beautifully formatted TXT
- **Flexible Time Ranges**: Generate reports for this week, last week, this month, or custom date ranges
- **Local Data Storage**: All your data stays on your machine in a local JSON file
- **Easy Export**: Copy to clipboard, save as file, or view in VS Code

## How It Works

1. **Install the extension** in VS Code or Cursor
2. **Open any git repository** - the extension automatically starts tracking
3. **Make commits** as you normally would
4. **Generate reports** using the command palette or status bar
5. **Export your reports** for weekly job reporting

## Usage

### Commands

Access these commands through the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- `Project Report: Generate Work Report` - Create a report for a specific time period
- `Project Report: View Tracked Projects` - See all projects being tracked
- `Project Report: Export Report` - Export a report to clipboard or file
- `Project Report: Open Settings` - Configure extension settings

### Automatic Tracking

The extension automatically:
- Detects when you open git repositories
- Identifies the current Git user for each repository
- Tracks new commits every 5 minutes (configurable)
- Filters commits to show only your work (excludes other contributors by default)
- Stores commit messages, file changes, and timestamps
- Shows notifications when new commits are detected

### User-Specific Filtering

By default, the extension only tracks and reports commits made by you (the current Git user):

- **Automatic Detection**: The extension reads your Git user email from each repository's configuration
- **Personal Reports**: Only your commits appear in reports, excluding work from other team members
- **Per-Repository**: Works correctly even if you use different Git identities across repositories
- **Configurable**: Disable filtering if you want to see all commits from all contributors

This feature ensures your reports accurately reflect only your work, making them perfect for individual job reporting and time tracking.

### Report Generation

Generate reports for:
- **This Week**: Monday to Sunday of current week
- **Last Week**: Previous week's Monday to Sunday
- **This Month**: 1st to last day of current month
- **Last Month**: Previous month's date range
- **Custom Range**: Specify your own start and end dates

## Configuration

Customize the extension behavior in VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "projectReportCompiler.autoTrack": true,
  "projectReportCompiler.trackInterval": 300000,
  "projectReportCompiler.excludePatterns": ["node_modules", ".git", "dist", "build"],
  "projectReportCompiler.reportFormat": "markdown",
  "projectReportCompiler.filterByCurrentUser": true
}
```

### Settings

- `autoTrack`: Enable/disable automatic commit tracking (default: true)
- `trackInterval`: How often to check for new commits in milliseconds (default: 5 minutes)
- `excludePatterns`: Directory patterns to exclude from tracking
- `reportFormat`: Default format for reports (markdown, html, or txt)
- `filterByCurrentUser`: Only track and report commits by the current Git user (default: true)

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run compile` to build the extension
4. Press `F5` to open a new VS Code window with the extension loaded

### Building VSIX Package

```bash
npm install -g vsce
npx vsce package --no-yarn
```

This creates a `.vsix` file that you can install manually in VS Code.

Or download the release .vsix file and use this command for vscode
```bash
code --install-extension release_file.vsix
```
or cursor
```bash
cursor --install-extension release_file.vsix
```
